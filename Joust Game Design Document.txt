Game title: Joust 

Short description of the game:

Game elements:
* Standard deck of 52 playing cards
* 1 die (any die can be used; we personally use a 6-sided die).

Number of players and age restriction: 
* 3+ players
* No age restrictions

Game rules and procedures:
1. Everyone (3 or more people) draws 3 cards.
2. Everyone reveals their hand.
2. The person with the best hand (determined using the same rules as Poker) has “initiative” and can choose someone to joust.
	a. If playing with 4 or more players, the person with the "worst" hand (i.e., fewest number of pairs, or lowest-value face card) has immunity.
3. The jouster and their target both roll a die.
	a. The winner of the die roll is determined by who rolls the higher number.
	b. If the outcome of the die is the same, both players re­roll until there is a winner.
4. Everyone places their cards into a discard pile.
	a. The loser of the die roll keeps one of the cards they drew this turn (they can choose which) and inserts the rest back into the deck.
	b. If keeping a card would cause the loser to have 3 cards, they are eliminated.
5. When the deck is getting low on cards, shuffle the discard pile back into the deck.
6. Once play has narrowed down to 2 people, they each draw 3 cards one last time. The person with the best hand is the winner of the game.
