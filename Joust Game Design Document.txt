Game title: Joust 

Short description of the game:

Game elements:
* Standard deck of 52 playing cards
* 1 die (any die can be used; we personally use a 6-sided die).

Number of players and age restriction: 
* 3+ players
* No age restrictions

Game rules and procedures:
1. Everyone (3 or more people) draws 3 cards
2. The person with the best hand (determined using the same rules as Poker) has “initiative” and can choose someone to joust.
3. The jouster and their target both roll a die.
	a. If the outcome of the die is the same, both players re­roll until there is a winner.
4. Everyone inserts all the cards they drew this turn back into the deck.
	a. The loser keeps one of the cards they drew this turn (they can choose which) and inserts the rest back into the deck.
	b. If keeping a card would cause the loser to have 3 cards, they are eliminated.
5. Once play has narrowed down to 2 people, they joust each other 3 times. Best of 3 is the winner.
