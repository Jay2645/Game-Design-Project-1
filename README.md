This is a physical game developed for California State University, Fullerton's CPSC 386 class, "Intro to Game Design".

# Project Requirements

The objective of this project is to design and develop a game that is not a video game. The design focus is on the rules, and how the rules affect gameplay. The game can be set up and played between 5 and 10 minutes, and for multiple players: two to four players. If your game can be played or requires more than four players, state clearly what needs to be done and what the rules are.
